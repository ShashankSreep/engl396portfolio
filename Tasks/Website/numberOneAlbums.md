## How to Move the *years* slider
If you want to keep the same **interval**, say a 5 year period, but would like to view for different 5 year periods: (2003 - 2008, 2013 - 2018), do the following: 

1) Adjust the slider to your desired interval size, by moving the left and right end points of the slider

2) Grab the middle of the slider with your mouse, and drag it left or right to adjust the period

<!-- Perhaps add images here -->
- If done correctly, you should see the years and album output below reflect the changes.
