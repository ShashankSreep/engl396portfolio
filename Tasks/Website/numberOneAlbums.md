## How to Adjust the *years* slider
a) To increase the range between starting and ending years, drag the right end of the slider to the right or the left end of the slider to the left 

b) To decrease the range between starting and ending years, draft the left end of the slider to the right, or the right end of the slider to the left

## How to Move the *years* slider
If you want to keep the same *interval*, say a 5 year period, but would like to view for different 5 year periods: (2003 - 2008, 2013 - 2018), do the following: 

1) Adjust the slider to your desired interval size, by moving the left and right end points of the slider
2) Grab the middle of the slider with your mouse, and drag it left or right to adjust the period
