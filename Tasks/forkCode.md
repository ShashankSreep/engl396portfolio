## Fork The Source Code from the GitHub Repository

**Note**: Forking a GitHub repository aloows for you to maintain version control independently without affecting the original repository
1) [Create]('LINKTOCREATE') a GitHub account, if you do not already have one
    - If you do have a GitHub account, make sure you are signed in

2) Once signed in, navigate to the [repository]('LINKTOREPO')

3) Click on the **Fork** button

4) Make sure your account name is the owner name, and select a repository repository name if you would like (although the default is perfectly fine as well)


5) Click on **Create Fork** at the bottom right of the page
    - If successfully done, you should see a repository created, with the ‘Repository name’ in your list of repositories

6) Navigate to your forked repository, and download the source code
    - [Clone]('HOWTOCLONE') the repository locally
