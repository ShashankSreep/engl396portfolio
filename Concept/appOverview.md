# Background <!-- ## Make this sound better in the future -->
**My Favorite Albums** is a web application that analyzes a user's album ratings through statistical and graphical analysis. Music enthusiasts and listeners can gain insights into their favorite albums, artists, and visualize those listening trends over time.

Using the user's custom album data, the application provides the following analysis:
- **Number One Albums**: Indentifies the highest-rated album for a given year
- **Bands And Artists**: Calculates the average rating and frequency for a specific artist or band
- **Top Albums By Year**: Ordered ranking of albums for a particular year
- **Vinyl**: Ranks top rated vinyls the user does not own, and then provides a ranking of years, based on most number of vinyls owned for that year
- **Band Comparison**: Graphical visualization of album ratings between bands or artists over time


## Customized Data <!-- Make this sound better -->
The application also supports user customization, as users can provide their personal album ranking in order to analyze their own data. In order to personalize data, users can provide structured album data in the form of a CSV (comma-separated values) file. This album file stores all of the data that is used throughout the application. 


## Open Source Development
For more experienced developers looking to utilize already existing functionality, the application is open source, and open to extensions. Developers can easily modify the source code, available on GitHub, in order to fit their needs.
