# Glossary

>**Note**: This contains a list of frequent terms used throughout the documentation and their meanings.

**Console**: A text interface, that can be used to interact with the computer program
Ex: By printing to the console, you can use this as a way to verify the program is performing the intended action/has the intended behavior

**Dataframe**: A dataframe in R is a data structure that collects vectors into a singular object, like a table
In a dataframe, the vectors all must be of the same length, but can be of different types

**Data Structure**: An object or a container, which provides a way to organize and store data, so it can be later accessed efficiently
Ex: Suppose you have a bookshelf, and you want to put a book
Easy to store a book, since you can navigate the bookshelf
Similarly, easy to retrieve a book, since you can navigate the bookshelf
However, if you didn’t store it in a bookshelf, it could be anywhere, thus harder/takes longer to find

**Function**: A function is a piece of code, which fundamentally performs a task
The primary purpose of using a function to encapsulate the code instead of writing the code line by line, is that a function provides reusability (Can use the same logic throughout the entire project)

**Parameters**: Parameters are inputs to a function that allow for code-reuse
Ex: Suppose you have a function that returns all of the Names from a CSV file
If you wanted to retrieve all the names starting with a specific letter, say ‘A’, you can pass letter as a parameter/input
This enables to reuse the overall code, as the parameter can be modified when calling the function
Ex: retrieve_all_names(‘A’), retrieve_all_names(‘B’) as opposed to manually hard-coding it within the function

**Vectors**: A list of items that are of the same type
Ex: fruits <- c(“banana”, “apple”, “orange”) => Vector of strings, that represent fruits

**User Interface (UI)**: A user interface is what the user interacts with, when using the application
Ex: When you open up the website for My Favorite Albums, and navigate by clicking the tabs, you are interacting with the user interface of the application
